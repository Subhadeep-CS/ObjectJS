Computed Properties

const myKey1="name";
const myKey2="age";

const value1="Subho";
const value2=23;

Now,you have to construct a object by using this variable and object look like 

Person={
    myKey1:value1,
    myKey2:value2,
}

like that and now you can do it by using bracket

const Person={};

Person[myKey1]=value1;

console.log(Person);

But problem is that if you have 10 variable then it's not the efficient way to write
like that,for this javascript has computed Properties of object where we can add
dynamic variable directly in object and construct object.

const Person={
    [myKey1]:value1,
    [myKey2]:value2,
};

and It will construct the object.

Example doing in computed.js file.
