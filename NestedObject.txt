Object inside Array.

When we have multiple object same type,then we using nested object or we construct 
a array and put all the object inside of the array.

when we build a array and put all the object inside the array,that is called
Array inside object.It's also called nested object.

inside ArrayObj.js we put all the example here.

const User=[
    {userId:1,name:"Subho"},
    {userId:2,name:"Ram"},
    {userId:3,name:"Shyam"},
];

we make a array User and put all three object inside it.

Now how we can access the property of array inside object.
console.log(User[0].userId);

Nested Object destructuring:-

1.first you have to create variable that destructuring array.

const [user1,user2,user3]=User;

Now I get the object in user1,user2,user3 and now destructuring the each and every object

******

How to destructuring object internal property with variable,

What happend when we want to destructure nested object. Firstly,we have to distruct the
array.

const [user1,user2,user3]=User;

Now we get first object of array inside the user1.Now we want to unpack this user1

what will do now we can do

const {userId,name}=user1;

that will unpack the user1 object but without using second line if we put this when we
destructure the array we will get same result.

const [{userId,name}, , ]=User;

That's the all facts of object destructuring.
