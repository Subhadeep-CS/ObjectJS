Destructuring is a technique to unpacking value from the array and object.

Object Destructuring is same as array Destructuring. but there's one difference.

now we make a object first

const Band={
    bandName:"fossils",
    famousSong:"hasnuhana",
};

Now I want to Destructuring that object Band so.what can I do now.

const {bandName,famousSong}=Band;

Here's comes the difference into picture,

When we are Destructuring a object,then we cannot change keyname when Destructuring it.
If we change the key name it cannot assign and we will get undefined,that's called
binding destructuring.

const Band={
    bandName:"fossils",
    famousSong:"hasnuhana",
};

const {bandName,famousSong}=Band;

console.log(bandName);
console.log(famousSong);

Now,if we want to change,then we will do assignment destructuring.

const {bandName:var1,famousSong:var2}=Band;

console.log(var1);
console.log(var2);

the type of variable is constant type.

facts of object destructuring.

We can create a new object using destructuring.

const Band1={
    bandName:"fossils",
    famousSong:"hansuhana",
    year:2018,
    anotherSong:"khonro fossils",
};

const {bandName,famousSong,...restProps}=Band1;

console.log(restProps);

//restProps is a object.

That's all for object destructuring.
