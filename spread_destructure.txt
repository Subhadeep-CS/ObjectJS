Spread operator in object:-

Using spread operator we can spread one object to another object and all properties avai
lable for the second object.

Here's some senario while spreading a object to another object.
1.scene 1=>

const Person1={
    name:"Subho",
    age: 23,
}

const Details={
    gender:"male",
};
//spraed the all properties and method of Person1 and Details inside the NewPerson Object.
const NewPerson={...Person1,...Details};
console.log(NewPerson);

2.Scene 2=>

When we have duplicate item in Object.

const Person1={
    name:"Subho",
    age: 23,
}

const Details={
    name:"Subhadeep",
    gender:"male",
};
//spraed the all properties and method of Person1 and Details inside the NewPerson Object.
const NewPerson={...Details,...Person1};
console.log(NewPerson);

 Here we see that Person1 and Details both object has name property and when we are 
 spread the object in a new object, then it will take last spreading object name.

 Here,we spread the Person object at last so the name value will be "Subho", if we
 spread Details object at last then the name value will be "Subhadeep".

Facts of Object.

When you have duplicate item inside the object then second propertie overwrite the first.

const a={
    x:1,
    x:2,
}

if we print
    console.log(a.x); then it will print 2 in console.

scene 3:-

We can spread static item inside an object,

    const String1={..."abc"};

{0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c'} , the object will look like this.

***Important point of spread operator:-

We can spread the element if the element is iterable 

const String1={..."abc"},

we can spread it because string is iterable in nature but we cannot spread any number
and all.
