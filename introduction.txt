What is object?

Everything in Javascript is object.You can see window object,document object etc.

Now,the question is that what is object? 

The defination of object quiet be different i Javascript. Actually Javascript object is 
not class-based object and there's no data type restriction.

So,object is collection of interelated data and function. Inside a object,we have some
variable called property and some method to manipulate the variable,called method.

Inside,the javascript object,there are key-value pair.

How to create object in Javascript?

const Person={}

Yes,we create a Person object which is empty.That is called empty object.

now,

const Person={name:"Subho",age:23};

Here we add some property in it.Though we say that Inside the object,we have key-value 
pair.Here the keys are name and age and values are "Subho" and 23, By default keys are
string type.

How to access data from the object?

There's two way to access data from the object.

1. By using (.) dot operator we can access data from the object.

Syntax

    Object_name.property_name;
    Object_name.method();

2.By using bracket([]), we can access data from the object.

Syntax

    Object_name["property_name"];
    Object_name["method()"]; //evals the return value otherwise return undefined.

How we can add property and method in object?

1.By using (.) dot operator

Using (.) operator we can add property inside an object.

Syntax:-

    Object_name.property_name=value;

If the property_name already exixts then It will update the value,if the property
does not exixts,it will add the property with value and you can add method also.

2.By using [] bracket we can also add some property in it.

Syntax:-

    Object_name["property_name"]=value;

If the property_name already exixts then It will update the value,if the property
does not exixts,it will add the property with value and you can add method also.

Difference between (.) and  bracket [] notatioon?

We see that . and [] notatioon wroks same but there is huge difference between dot
and bracket.

1.dot notation wroks only on static data, but bracket wroks on dynamic data and now
the question is what is static data and what is dynamic data.

For example

    we have veriable const key="email";

Now,you want to add that variable_value "email" as a key of object.Now if you use . 
notation what you will do

        Object_name.key="abc@gmail.com";
When you do that thing, key will add as a property but we have to add email.

So,we have to do something,for which key will be replaced by the email.for that we use
bracket notation.

        Object_name[expression]="abc@gmail.com";
        Object_name[key]="abc@gmaail.com"
When you do that key will evaluated by the bracket and it will replace by email and 
add email as a property.

Means using bracket notation we can add data dynamically. That's the huge difference
between . and bracket.

2. Suppose we put a key inside object which name is "person gender" which value is 
male and I want to access that property.

    const Person={name:"Subho",
        "person gender":"male";
    }

If we want to access the person gender property then it will ocuur a SyntaxError.

        console.log(Person.person gender);

Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list.

But,if you want to access it by using bracket notation then you can access the property.

        console.log(Person["person gender"]);

This is the two key difference between the . and [] notation.
