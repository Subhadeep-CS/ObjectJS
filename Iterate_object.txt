How to iterate object?

We can iterate a object in two ways.

1. for in loop
2. Using Object.keys method and for of loop.

1.Using for in loop.

Suppose,we construct a object

const Person={
    name:"Subho",
    age:23,
    gender:"male"
};

Now I want to iterate the objcet using for in loop.

for(let Key in Person)
{
    console.log(key);
}

It will print the all key and all.Actually,in the for in loop,each iteration we get key
inside the Key variable.

Now,the fact is how we can print the property,if you print by using . then you will get
undefined,because . notation used for static value,so it will try to find the key 
property inside the Person object and It will not there so it's print undefined.

For,printing we use bracket notation.

for(let Key in Person)
{
    //console.log(Person.key);
    //console.log(Person[key]);
}

We see it details in iteration.js file.

2. Object.keys(); method

We can iterate the object using Object.keys() method and for of loop.

By using Object.keys() method we get a array with all the keys inside it. 

Syntax:-

    Object.keys(Object_name);
    console.log(Object.keys(Object_name));

now,we can iterate this array by using for of loop.

Syntax: 

for(let key of Object.keys(Person))
{
    console.log(Person[key]);
}
